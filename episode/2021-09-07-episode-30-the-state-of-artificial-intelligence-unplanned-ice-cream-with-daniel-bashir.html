title: Episode 30 - The State of Artificial Intelligence & Unplanned Ice Cream with
  Daniel Bashir
subtitle: GPT-3, Neural Networks, Recommendations Algorithm, Self-Driving Cars and
  Setting Our Expectations
description: '<p>Daniel Bashir is on the show today, we go deep into Artificial Intelligence
  and talk about his new book which takes in contemporary ethical and political considerations
  surrounding AI and its use in recommendations, bias in criminal justice and the
  dangers of large language models. This is a deep conversation and a really great
  talk. I think I''ve had to listen to this several times myself just to take in all
  the learnings. Luckily Daniel makes this really accessible for us all to get our
  teeth into with stories of unplanned ice cream and helping us decipher the difference
  between Pawns, Prawns and Porn. Daniel is a really smart guy and a great orator,
  so settle in and hold onto your hats.</p><br><p>Book ethics in society: <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/towards-machine-literacy-by-daniel-bashir#/"
