title: Episode 36 - The Modern CTO and Code in Space with Rakesh Ravuri
subtitle: Rakesh is CTO at Publicis Sapient, is a former Director at Amazon and former
  Architect at Tesco - He's a hands-on kind of leader, and even has code running in
  space!
description: "<p>Rakesh and Chris met back in 2013 when we worked together at Tesco.
  I was fresh out of Amazon at the time and maybe a bit brash, young, egotistical
  and opinionated back then... as if I've changed in any way other than getting older...
  so initially, I think rubbed him up the wrong way, but over the next 18months I
  think at the very least we developed a mutual respect, enough that he'd accept our
  invitation to join us as a guest on the show. And I'm so glad because he's a really
  smart guy and maybe the only person I know with code running in space.</p><p>So
  we'll try and get into that, but also what he's been doing since we last spoke at
  Tesco as he's now left the UK and gone back to India to serve as CTO for Publicis
  Sapient via a stint at Amazon.</p><br><p>Edited by: Simon Hoerner</p><p>Produced
