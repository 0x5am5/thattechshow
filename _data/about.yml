content: "That Tech Show was born out of two nerds love for tech having lived and worked in it for many years building apps, designing websites and running teams for large enterprise organisations. We know what goes into these endeavours and the unspoken heroes that are working away defining the future. We hope to uncover hidden gems and give voice to those who are making it all happen. Each episode is conversational and loose but will revolve around your key skillset. Don't be afraid to let the topic meander into interesting territories and we encourage you to speak your mind on what you care about most. We'll look to challenge convention and uncover new ideas in your field of work as we go into it blind and curious."
