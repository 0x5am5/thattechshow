content: <p>That Tech Show was born out of two nerds' love for tech having lived
  and worked in it for many years building apps, designing websites, and running
  teams for large enterprise organisations.<p/>
  <p>We know what goes into these endeavors and the unspoken heroes that are working away defining the future.
  We hope to uncover hidden gems and give voice to those who are making it all
  happen.</p>
  <p>Each episode is conversational and loose but will revolve around your
  key skillset. Don't be afraid to let the topic meander into interesting
  territories and we encourage you to speak your mind on what you care about
  most. </p>
  <p>We'll look to challenge convention and uncover new ideas in your field
  of work as we go into it blind and curious.</p>
